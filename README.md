### Hi, I'm Andrew! ðŸ‘‹

A highly motivated software developer, recently trained at Makers Academy.

I graduated with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Bristol where I was first introduced to the world of coding. After university I worked in the engineering sphere for several years, building on a number of competencies such as problem solving, communication, leadership and team working skills. I am now keen to apply this wealth of skills and experience to a new-found passion in software development.
